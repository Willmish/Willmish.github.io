Welcome to my corner of the Internet! [Stay awhile, and read on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg).
I am Szymon Duchniewicz, final year student at UCL, pursuing a Master of Engineering degree from Computer Science. I am also active in Open Source, co-chairing the [Carbon Aware SDK project](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk) and working part-time as an Open Technology Engineer at [Avanade](https://www.avanade.com/en-gb).

## Tech Stack

I dabble in many areas of computer science, but with a stronger focus on Embedded Systems, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I also occasionally take part in game jams, even [winning some of them](https://hist0r.itch.io/the-deluge).

My programming languages of choice are C, Python üêç and Rust ü¶Ä, but you will find me using .NET, GoLang from time to time.

## Interests

Apart from the (I am told) obvious passion for Computer Science, there are a few other things I hold close to heart - windsurfing and surfing. Ask me over a beer/coffee and I will be happy to talk about any of them!
