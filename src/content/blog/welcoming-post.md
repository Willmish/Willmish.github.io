description: The Hello World of my blog!

Hello! What better way to start sharing my thoughts and work, then with a "Hello World"!

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

I am currently working hard on finishing my Master degree at UCL, specifically my Senior Project: "Improving Space Efficiency of the Memory Management System of CantripOS" (title WIP :) ). I will be sharing some tips I and hurdles I found while working on it, specifically related to [seL4 Microkernel](https://sel4.systems/) development, [CantripOS](https://opensecura.googlesource.com/manifest/+/refs/heads/master/README.md) and kernel software debugging. See you then, and wish me luck!
